	<h3>Call For Student Research Competition</h3>

	<h5>ACM Student Research Competition @ SOSP 2019</h5>
	<p>
	In 2019, SOSP will host its second <a href="http://src.acm.org/">ACM 
	    Student Research Competition (SRC)</a>, sponsored by ACM and
	<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Research</a>.  
	This competition offers undergraduate and graduate students a unique 
	forum to experience the research world, present their research results 
	to conference attendees, and compete for prizes.
	</p>

	<p>
	The ACM SRC at SOSP 2019 consists of three parts: (1) research abstract 
	submission; (2) poster presentation; (3) a research talk. The 
	first-place winners of the competition will be invited to participate 
	in the ACM Student Research Competition Grand Finals.
	</p>

	<p>
	Participate in this exciting competition! Submit your work to the ACM 
	Student Research Competition at SOSP 2019. Win a $500 travel stipend to 
	attend the SOSP conference in Huntsville, Ontario (and apply for a
	<a href="cfss.html">SOSP student scholarship</a> to request more 
	support)!
	</p>

  <h5>Student Research Competition Program</h5>
  The student research competition program is available in <a 
     href="srcinfo.pdf">PDF form here</a>.

	<h5>How to Participate:</h5>

	<h5>First Round Competition: Submit a Research Abstract</h5>
	<p>
	The submission site is:
  <a href="https://sosp19src.hotcrp.com/">https://sosp19src.hotcrp.com/</a>
	</p>

	<p>
	To participate in the competition, submit a 2-page research abstract 
	related to the main themes of the conference (see the
	<a href="cfp.html">SOSP'19 Call for Papers</a> for a list of conference 
	topics).  The submission should describe: the research problem and 
	motivation, background and related work, approach and uniqueness, 
	results, and contributions.  Abstracts will be judged based on how well 
	they cover these aspects of the work.
	</p>

	<p>
	Research abstract submissions should contain original, unpublished 
	material that is not under review at any other archival forum, 
	including journals, conferences, and workshops with copyrighted 
	proceedings. If the work is accepted by a conference or journal by the 
	time of SRC submission deadline (but not yet published), you should not 
	submit it to SRC unless the SRC submission contains sufficient new 
	material.
	</p>

	<p>
	We will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt t I am also a bit concerned that
anyone who does see what is there might think that
it only applies to someone paro 
	anonymize your submission. Avoid identifying yourself or your 
	institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references 
	or acknowledgments). <b>The first page should indicate whether it is 
	    undergraduate or graduate category in place of the author 
	    names.</b>
	</p>

	<p>
	The research abstract must conform at the time of submission to the 
	SOSP 2019 Submission Rules regarding Anonymity, Originality, and 
	Formatting (see the <a href="cfp.html">SOSP'19 Call for Papers</a>), 
	and must not exceed 2 pages, including all text, appendices, and 
	figures.  Bibliographic references do not count against the page limit.  
	All submissions must be in English.  Submissions must be in PDF format.
	</p>

	<p>
	Abstracts must be submitted electronically by August 14th, 2019. A 
	panel of experts will review the submissions and select the students to 
	participate in the on-site stage of the Student Research Competition, 
	which will be held at SOSP 2019 in Huntsville Ontario, Canada.
	</p>

	<p><b>
	Students who are selected to participate in the main competition at the 
	SOSP conference round will receive a stipend for their travel expenses, 
	up to a maximum of US$500. If you would need more support to attend 
	SOSP, you should also apply for a <a href="cfss.html">student 
	    scholarship</a>.  The deadline for those applications is July 30, 
	2019, which is substantially earlier than the SRC deadline.
	</b></p>

	<h5>Second Round Competition: Present a Poster</h5>
	<p>
	The second round of the competition will take place in a poster session 
	at SOSP 2019. This is your opportunity to present your research to 
	conference attendees and leading experts in the systems software 
	fields, including the SRC committee.
	</p>
	<p>
	Judges will review the posters and speak to participants about their 
	research. The judges will evaluate the research (quality, novelty, and 
	significance) and the presentation of the research (poster, discussion) 
	and select students to advance to the final round of the competition.
	</p>

	<h5>Final Round Competition: Give a Presentation</h5>
	<p>
	Select students will continue by giving a short presentation of their 
	research before a panel of judges and other attendees in a special 
	session at the SOSP 2019 conference. After each presentation, there 
	will be a short question and answer session.
	</p>
	<p>
	Evaluations are based on the presenter’s knowledge of his/her research 
	area, the contribution of the research, and the quality of the oral and 
	visual presentation. At most three winners will be chosen in each 
	category, undergraduate and graduate, and receive prizes.
	</p>

	<h5>The SRC Grand Finals</h5>
	<p>
	The first-place winner in each category (undergraduate and graduate) 
	from the SRC held at SOSP 2019 will advance to the SRC Grand Finals. A 
	different panel of judges evaluates the winners of all SRCs held during 
	the calendar year against each other via the web. Three undergraduates 
	and three graduates will be chosen as the SRC Grand Finals winners. 
	They are invited, along with their advisors, to the annual ACM Awards 
	Banquet, where they receive formal recognition.
	</p>

	<h5>Prizes</h5>
	<p>
	The top three winners in each category (undergraduate and graduate) 
	will be recognized during the conference and will receive prizes of 
	US$500, US$300, and US$200, respectively.
	</p>

	<h5>Requirements</h5>
	<ol>
	  <li>Participants must be undergraduate or graduate students pursuing 
	      an academic degree at the time of initial submission.</li>
	  <li>Participants must be current student members of the ACM, and must 
	      provide their ACM member number.</li>
	  <li>Team projects will be accepted from Undergraduate students. One 
	      person should be designated by the team to attend the conference 
	      and make the oral presentation. This person along with another 
	      team member will be eligible for travel reimbursement for up to 
	      $500.00. Should the designated presenter win first, second or 
	      third place in competition only they will receive the medal and 
	      monetary award.</li>
	  <li>Only individual research is accepted from Graduate (Masters or 
	      PhD program) students; group research projects will not be 
	      considered. If you are part of a group research project and want 
	      to participate in an SRC, you can only present your part of the 
	      research. You must submit a single-authored version of your work. 
	      If your abstract is selected, only you will receive the travel 
	      stipend and monetary award (should you win).</li>
	  <li>Supervisors of the work may not be listed as co-authors.</li>
	  <li>Students may only participate in one SRC per program year (April 
	      1- March 31). Students that have applied to an SRC, but have not 
	      been accepted, may respond to other SRC calls for participation 
	      during the program year.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
	<b>Important:</b> The student author of the accepted abstract must 
	register and present the work at SOSP 2019. The accepted abstracts will 
	be published on the SIGOPS website.
	</p>

	<h5>For More Information</h5>
	<p>
	For additional information, visit the official
	<a href="http://src.acm.org/">ACM Student Research Competition 
	    website</a>.  For questions, please contact the
	<a href="mailto:sosp2019src@gmail.com">co-chairs</a>.

	<h5>Frequently Asked Questions</h5>
	<p>
	<b>Q: I am a PhD student. Am I eligible to participate in the SRC?</b>
	<br/>
	Yes. As a PhD student, you will compete in the Graduate category of the 
	competition.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Q: What should I write in my research abstract?</b>
	<br/>
	A submission to the competition should describe recently completed or 
	ongoing student research related to the topics covered by SOSP. It is 
	important that your research abstract discusses (1) research problem 
	and motivation, (2) background and related work, (3) approach and 
	uniqueness, and (4) results and contributions. The committee will 
	assess your research abstract along these dimensions.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Q: What criteria will the judges use to evaluate the 
	    abstract/research?</b>
	<br/>
	The judges will assess research abstracts based on four criteria: 
	Problem and motivation (5 points); Background and related work (5 
	points); Approach and uniqueness (10 points); and Results and 
	contribution (10 points). For the poster presentation, the criteria are 
	Oral presentation (10 points), Visual presentation (10 points), 
	Research methods (15 points), and Significance of contribution (10 
	points). For the conference oral presentation, the criteria are 
	Knowledge of research area (15 points), Contribution of research (10 
	points), and Presentation (10 points).
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Q: I noticed that first round participants receive a travel 
	    reimbursement of up to $500. Will the participants also qualify for 
	    a registration waiver or free/discounted student lodging?</b>
	<br/>
	There will be no additional discounts towards registration or lodging.  
	Consider applying for <a href="cfss.html">SOSP student travel 
	    grants</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Q: My research is not related to systems software or any of the main 
	    themes of the SOSP conference. Can I still participate in the 
	    Student Research Competition?</b>
	<br/>
	Yes, but not at SOSP. Participate in a SRC at conference that is 
	related to your research. To participate in the competition at SOSP, 
	your research needs to be related to the main themes of the SOSP 
	conference (see the topics for <a href="cfp.html">SOSP 2019</a>). If 
	your research is not among the topics relevant for SOSP, please check 
	the <a href="http://src.acm.org/submissions.html">list of current SRC 
	    calls</a> to find a conference that is better related.  If you 
	don’t find a conference that covers your research, you can participate 
	in the SRC competition at the SIGCSE conference.
